In the vast expanse of the night,
A sea of stars shines ever bright.
Each twinkle, a story yet untold,
A glimpse into the universe's hold.

They shimmer and dance in the dark,
Like diamonds strewn across a velvet park.
They whisper of galaxies far away,
Of planets and moons in cosmic ballet.

So gaze upon the celestial sight,
And marvel at the wonders of the night.
