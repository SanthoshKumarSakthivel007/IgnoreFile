The wind whispers secrets in the night,
A soft melody, a gentle plight.
It carries stories from lands afar,
Of dreams, of hopes, of love's sweet scar.

Through rustling leaves and branches old,
Its voice is heard, clear and bold.
It speaks of tales long forgotten,
Of memories lost, of hearts begotten.

In the stillness of the night, it sings,
A lullaby of nature's gentle wings.
